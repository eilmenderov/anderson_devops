Write a bash/powershell script using either aws cli or powershell: What the script should do:
* Collect EBS SnapshotID list and corresponding StartTime value
* Show a list of snapshots older than N days/hours/minutes (whichever is more convenient for testing) and their
size.
* Optionally, you can filter snapshots by Tag:Value and
output the same information.
* Optionally, you can add the option to fill selected snapshots in s3.
* You can make up your own usecase )
